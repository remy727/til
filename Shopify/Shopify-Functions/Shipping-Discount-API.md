# Limitations and considerations
- All plans: Stores on any plan can use public apps that are distributed through the Shopify App Store and contain Shopify Functions.
- Shopify Plus: Only stores on a Shopify Plus plan can use custom apps that contain Shopify Function APIs.

# Notes
- [It is impossible to access the discount codes added by the customer](https://shopifypartners.slack.com/archives/C0225DTE1M1/p1684241334778749)
